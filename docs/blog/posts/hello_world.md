## Article ideas for Alan

1.  Motivation
    1. What prototype.js got right / Why Best Practices are shaped by language and ecosystem
    2. Intrinsic, Accidental, and Intentional Complexity wrt GPU APIs
    3. GPUs are modern day Lisp Machines / How C is a high level language and WGSL is a low level language
    4. Kinds of programs, their structures and tradeoffs / which ones Alan is designed for / latency axis VS volume axis VS CPUs per user
    5. The missing QBASIC/Flash niche, but safe/easy and correct programming language is missing in modern day development; unfortunate barrier to entry for new developers, LLMs are not the answer
2.  Demonstration
    1. Shadertoy-like example in Alan / End with something beyond Shadertoy capabilities?
    2. Bitcon-like example in Alan / finding all hash collisions for an input using GPGPU
    3. High perf Vector database in GPGPU / highly parallel index scans
    4. GenAI (LLM, Whisper, basic classifier?) in Alan / come on ride that (hype) train, choo choo!
    5. Interleave Shadertoy and GenAI examples to demonstrate easier cooperative GPU utilization
3.  Tutorial
    1. Binding Rust and Javascript
    2. Modules and dependencies
    3. Alternatives to uncontrolled loops and why they're the default
    4. Standard library documentation
    5. Generic functions and types
    6. Sum types deep dive
    7. Networking? Tasks/Jobs?
