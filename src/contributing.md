# Contributing to Alan

Like most other open source projects, contributing to the compiler or AVM requires a [CLA Aggreement](https://cla-assistant.io/alantech/) and here is a current [list of good starter tasks](https://github.com/alantech/alan/contribute).

Let us know if you build an open source library or API client in Alan. We would love to review it, showcase it and/or just talk to you. Reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XatB9we) or email us at hello at alantechnologies dot com for any comments or questions :)
