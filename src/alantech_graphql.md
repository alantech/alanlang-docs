### @alantech/graphql***

I hate making this suggestion, but front-end devs *love* GraphQL, and alan is uniquely positioned to be able to handle wild GraphQL queries efficiently and potentially with minimal impedance mismatch between the code you write and the GraphQL API you support (but we have to write logic to automatically generate a GraphQL schema for the registered queries and mutations, and it's not going to *perfectly* fit). It could be a great selling point coupled with `@std/datastore` for turn-key backends.

I can see a lot of value having it in the standard library so devs can use it immediately, but I also want to jettison this thing the moment the frontend world gets tired of this shitty fad (at least I hope its a fad).
