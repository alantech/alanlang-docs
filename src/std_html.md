### @std/html***

Constructing HTML should be relatively straightforward (it could have a DOM-like API and generate XML-compliant HTML) while parsing HTML would require mimicking decades of quirks the browsers support. :/

It still seems useful for a goal of kicking Node to the curb, and if done better than Node (which has never officially supported it) it might attract devs who aren't even interested in any of the value props of Alan.

We might also be able to, ah, borrow, Mozilla's Rust implementation here, since the Servo project has built one.
