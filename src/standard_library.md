## Standard Library

The [Alan Standard Library](https://github.com/alantech/alan/tree/main/std) is still small and barely complete enough to make non-trivial programs with, at the moment. We intend to follow the "batteries included" ethos of Python and Java and include many libraries such that "normal" usage of the language only requires libraries for access to third-party services, and then only as a convenience.
