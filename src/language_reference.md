# Language Reference

To understand `alan`, we will first go through the syntactic building blocks of the language using example fragments of code (since the grammar is still in flux, it can be referenced in the `src/main/antlr/Lang.g4` file for those interested. Once solidified, snippets from that file will be backported here). Afterwards, a reference of all of the built-in functionality and libraries will be listed.
