#### Constants

Constants are one of the two things that can be defined in both the module scope and a function scope (the other being more functions). The syntax is simply:

```
const varname: typename = constvalue
```

where typename must be an existing type and the `constvalue` must be replaced with a number, boolean, string, etc. (Actually no etc, yet, as user-defined types can't be defined as a constant, yet, but that will change!)
