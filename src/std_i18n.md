### @std/internationalization or @std/i18n***

Simple tools for managing localization of text for different regions. There are lots of aspects here involving language selection (`en`), country-specific language dialect selection (`en_US`), numeric data representation (and pluralization), date and time formatting, currency formatting, etc.

I've done some of this work before, but I feel it needs a lot of thought to get right. Baking it into the standard library feels justified to me with greater and greater numbers of companies and people interacting internationally.
