# Examples with Explanations

In this section, several examples will be demonstrated with the Alan language. Some of them will be repetitious, showing multiple ways to accomplish the same thing.

Attempting to force a single way to do things, as Python pushes for, can make things easy things easier, but breaking those patterns to be more concise in a particular problem domain can raise the actual clarity of what is happening and why for those working on it, and is why all fields of endeavour develop their own terminology and notation over time.

Alan attempts to make these situations clearer by requiring the explicit declaration of the notation in use so people new to the notation can read that mapping and understand what's going on better.
