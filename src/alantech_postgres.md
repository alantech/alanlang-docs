### @alantech/postgres**

A database client for postgres. Not sure if it should be part of the standard library or something that can be acquired from our github repo (and potentially eventually given to the Postgres organization?

Used by `datastore` as an implementation backend. Will we need to split the DHT-based implementation for `datastore` into another standard library?
