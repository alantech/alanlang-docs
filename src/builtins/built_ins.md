### Built-ins

All module-based languages have some things that are included without specifically importing anything. Some keep it to a minimum (Java) and some have a pretty high rate of inclusion (Python). Alan biases more towards the Python end of the spectrum. Concepts and functionality common across many modules should not be manually imported all of the time, especially with the requirement that imports are fully qualified to improve legibility.

The built-ins for Alan all involve the built-in types and the functions and operators to manipulate them.
