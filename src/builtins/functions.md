#### Built-in Functions

The [function](../functions.md) signatures will be written in the form `functionName(argumentType, argumentType): returnType` with a brief description above each. These functions will be grouped into general categories, such as type coersion, arithmetic, etc. Because of [multiple dispatch](../functions.md#function-dispatch) you may see the same function name repeated multiple times, while other times you may see the use of the `any` interface for a function that operates on multiple types. When you see multiple dispatch being used with specific types, that means there's an optimized implementation for that specific type, while the use of the `any` interface means that this was not done (many times because it was not necessary).
